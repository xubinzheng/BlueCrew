Not only is an asset’s current location noted but also its historical movement.\r\n####Type: hybrid\r\n￼￼\r\n\r\n###Overview:\r\nTraditionally for local area wireless connections there has existed a trade-off between power consumption and distance. With low energy Bluetooth (Bluetooth Smart) there is now an open, no- license-required wireless LAN technology that consumes much less energy than before while maintaining the same communication distance.\r\nTeam Blue Crew intends to use this new relatively low cost, low-power-consumption communication technology and an IoT backend to track the movement of high value assets. The scenario we first envision is tracking assets in a hospital environment where the location of all important assets can be located. Not only is an asset’s current location noted but also its historical movement.\r\n\r\nSome of the features of keeping location history of assets/equipment are:\r\n\r\n•Location on demand\r\n•Over time which physical area or related groups have used an asset\r\n•Is an asset on property or not, if not when and where was it last monitored\r\n\r\nSome possible benefits in a hospital environment are:\r\n•Effective and efficient utilization of equipment is vital. Does staff use equipment in manner intended and as much as planned?\r\n•Obviously preventing theft of equipment saves costs and may lower capital equipment expenditures\r\n•Perhaps quality of service to patients can be improved by monitoring overall pattern of equipment used in the hospital\r\n•Inventory effort is vastly reduced\r\n•Insurance costs may lower if systems preventing theft are in place\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages of Smart Bluetooth tracking application\r\nDevice – in many IoT applications the costs of the physical (BOM) device and its development are barriers since in many cases there is a costly custom aspect. Development costs are often vastly underestimated due to lack of understanding of RF and software effort. In the case of a Smart Bluetooth solution it is an off-the-shelf solution that requires no software development at the device level since a Smart Bluetooth beacon states its “name”. The device is ready today.\r\n\r\nIoT Application Platform – The value-add development is performed at the “backend”. The customization needed for each IoT customer is performed at the platform level. The asset location history data is maintained, “mined”, and presented for customers in manner to provide highest value. There should be common needs among high asset customer types – hospital, R&D facilities, university campus, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frond-end part application fork the open source DropdownMenu from https://github.com/nmattisson/DropdownMenu\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first application is IBM BlueMix Cloud List service. The application fork the Bluemix SDK. The mean purpose is upload the UUID of a BKon device to mobile data service on Bluemix automaticly.\r\n\r\nThen the user can open the second application is main application. User can use that application to check every single BKon device.\r\n\r\nThe three main target:\r\n\r\nFirst: design for nurse\r\n\r\nSecond: design for accounting man\r\n\r\nThrid: design for insurance company\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation:\r\n\r\nUsing CocoaPods:\r\n\r\n1. Add `pod 'DropdownMenu'` to your Podfile.\r\n2. Run `pod install`\r\n3. Open the xcworkspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nils Mattisson, Martin Hartl\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
